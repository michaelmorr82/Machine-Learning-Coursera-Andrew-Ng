The following files are solutions to the online Coursera course 'Machine Learning' by Andrew Ng. 
the solutions are provided in MATLAB and Python<P>

This course provides a broad  introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include:
(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) 
Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in 
machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from 
numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots 
(perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, 
and other areas.<P>
